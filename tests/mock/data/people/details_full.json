The all-star cast includes Jennifer Aniston, Dane Cook, Morgan Freeman, Jimmy Kimmel, Shia LaBeouf, John Legend, Ray Liotta, CORE co-founder Sean Penn, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts.  This virtual special featured a series of memorable moments, including LaBeouf's hilariously accurate portrayal of Jeff Spicoli enjoyed by Penn himself, Morgan Freeman's dramatic narration, Julia Roberts (Stacy Hamilton) and Aniston's (Linda Barrett) adorable friendship, and a comical reenactment between Aniston (Linda) and Pitt (Brad Hamilton) as their characters shared a flirtatious scene in a daydream sequence.  This event benefited CORE’s COVID-19 relief efforts to protect vulnerable communities as well as our friends at Reform Alliance.",

When Emily tells Kathy that things were awesome, their friendship suffers, at the same so does Kathy's marriage.

Actors such as Brad Pitt (as a crazy person on the streets in the rain), Isabelle Huppert (as Greta Garbo), Steve Buscemi (as a mad butcher chewing gum on a variety show), Robert Downey Jr. (as a dreaming corpse in a Rembrandt painting), and Winona Ryder (as Winnie, the main female character in Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days, buried up to her neck in sand) were asked to “think of nothing\" and move slowly and steadily to collaborate in Wilson's vision of who they might be.",

Rounding out the tape are some great cheesey commercials, mostly for foods that look grossly unappetizing, and some with sell out American celebrities.

It was the first of its genre on American television and in the world, and is the fifth-longest running American television series. Originally a two-hour program on weekdays, it expanded to Sundays in 1987 and Saturdays in 1992. The weekday broadcast expanded to three hours in 2000, and to four hours in 2007.\n\nToday's dominance was virtually unchallenged by the other networks until the late 1980s, when it was overtaken by ABC's Good Morning America. Today retook the Nielsen ratings lead the week of December 11, 1995, and held onto that position for 852 consecutive weeks until the week of April 9, 2012, when it was beaten by Good Morning America yet again. In 2002, Today was ranked #17 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest Television  Shows of All Time.",

To name but a few: David Fincher, Quentin Tarantino, the Coen brothers, Terrence Malick, James Gray and soon Damien Chazelle. This documentary dives into the brain of a complex, brilliant and endearing personality, far from the cliché of a world-famous movie icon to discover the hidden side of the most handsome man in the world.",

En très peu de temps, il devient une véritable star et sa collaboration avec le réalisateur David Fincher donne naissance aux films cultes Seven, Fight Club et L'Étrange Histoire de Benjamin Button. Il tourne dans de nombreux autres succès comme Entretien avec un vampire de Neil Jordan, Ocean's Eleven et ses suites de Steven Soderbergh, Troie de Wolfgang Petersen, Inglourious Basterds de Quentin Tarantino et World War Z de Marc Forster. Au cours de sa carrière, il a reçu quatre nominations aux Oscars et cinq nominations aux Golden Globes, dont un remporté pour L'Armée des douze singes de Terry Gilliam en 1996.\n\nSex-symbol des années 1990, Brad Pitt est le premier acteur élu deux fois « Homme le plus sexy du monde » par le magazine People en 1995 et en 2000. Avec sa femme Angelina Jolie (rencontrée sur le tournage de Mr et Mrs Smith et qui a demandé le divorce en septembre 2016), il est le père de 6 enfants. Leur couple est très médiatisé dans les années 2000, y compris dans leurs actions humanitaires (à l'occasion notamment du tsunami de 2004 et de l'ouragan Katrina).\n\nÀ partir de 2002, il s'investit dans la production via sa société Plan B Entertainment avec des films tels que Les Infiltrés de Martin Scorsese et Twelve Years a Slave de Steve McQueen, qui ont chacun été récompensés par l'Oscar du meilleur film en 2007 et 2014, The Tree of Life de Terrence Malick, qui a reçu la Palme d'or au Festival de Cannes en 2011, ou des succès publics comme World War Z."

A Missouri Egyetemen újságírást tanult (főleg reklám szakirányban), de ezen kívül különféle iskolai szórakoztató műsorokban is szerepet vállalt.  Tanulmányai befejeztével Kaliforniába költözött, ahol számos munkát vállalt. Kipróbálta a limuzin-sofőrködést, de szállított hűtőket is. Az el Pollo Loco nevű cégnél dolgozva még csirkekosztümben is feltűnt az utcán. Ridley Scott felfigyelt a fiatal srácra, és szerepet ajánlott neki a Thelma és Louise (1991) című filmjében, aki ezután lassan, de biztosan elindult a filmcsillagok útján. A 12 majom (1995) című, posztapokaliptikus alkotás miatt elutasított egy filmszerepet Tom Hanks-szel, végül azonban Terrry Gilliam filmje meghozta számára az első Oscar-jelölést.  Érdekesség, hogy 1997-ben készült filmje, a %% (1997) óta Brad Pitt nem teheti be a lábát Kínába.\n\nKarrierjének fordulópontját a Trója (2004) jelentette, melynek köszönhetően elfoglalhatta helyét az akciósztárok között. Ezt követte 2005-ben a Mr. és Mrs. Smith (2005), melynek forgatása során megismerkedett Angelina Jolieval, aki miatt elvált korábbi feleségétől.\n\nKarrierje során számos különböző műfajú filmben játszott, melybe éppúgy beletartoznak a hollywoodi szuperprodukciók (Megaagy – 2010), és a komoly színészi kavlitásokat igánylő alkotások (Becstelen brigantyk – 2009, Az élet fája – 2011). Két jelölést gyűjtött be az évek során: egyet a Benjamin Button különös élete (2008) című filmben nyújtott alakításáért, a másikat  a Pénzcsináló (2011) című drámáért.  1996-ban kezdődött kapcsolata Gwyneth Paltrowval, akivel 1997-ben szakítottak, majd 1999-ben feleségül vette Jennifer Anistont, akitől 2005-ben vált el.

Jego ojciec był kierownikiem firmy transportu ciężarowego, a matka pedagogiem szkolnym. Jego rodzina przeprowadziła się do Springfield w Missouri, gdzie Brad pracował jako sprzedawca dla Colonel Day's Levi Emporium. Chodził do wyższej szkoły Kickapoo. Grał w tenisa i koszykówkę, a poza tym należał do kółka teatralnego i chóru. Skończył University of Missouri i zdobył tytuł magistra dziennikarstwa ze specjalnością - reklama. Jeszcze przed otrzymaniem dyplomu, przeprowadził się do Los Angeles, gdzie zamiast kontynuować naukę marketingu i projektowania graficznego, zajął się karierą modela i aktora. Na początku pracował tam jako kelner, reklamował restaurację El Pollo Loco przebrany za kurczaka, a za zarobione pieniądze, opłacał lekcje aktorstwa. Jego pierwszą rolą było wcielenie się w postać Randy'ego w serialu \"Dallas\". Później pojawiał się na małym ekranie w serialach takich jak \"21 Jump Street\", czy \"Opowieści z krypty\". Następnie zaczął otrzymywać propozycje zagrania w innych serialach np. \"Glory Days\", albo filmach np. \"Reporter\", \"Za młoda by umrzeć?\", gdzie poznał 16-letnią Juliettę Lewis, z którą spotykał się przez 3 lata. Jednak prawdziwą popularność zdobył rolą J.D. w filmie Ridleya Scotta 'Thelma i Louise\". Na dużym ekranie Brad wystąpił w \"Johnny Suede\", który na festiwalu w Locarno w 1992 roku zdobył nagrodę Złotego Lamparta w kategorii - najlepszy film. Wkrótce potem magazyn People ogłosił go najseksowniejszym wśród żyjących. Na swoim koncie ma trzy nominacje do Oscara, oraz Złotego Globa i Saturna za rolę w filmie \"12 małp\". 16 czerwca 1997 roku ogłoszono zerwanie jego zaręczyn z Gwyneth Paltrow którą poznał na planie filmu \"Siedem\", z którą był przez 2 lata. 29 lipca 2000 roku ożenił się z Jennifer Aniston, gwiazdą serialu \"Przyjaciele\"."
